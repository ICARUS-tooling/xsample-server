/**
 * Encapsulates all the information to populate a dataverse with data and maniests 
 * for XSample. 
 * <p>
 * Note that the setup is performed in a single path effectively top-to-bottom 
 * following the physical representation of the setup data. This means that
 * resolution of ids to actual files in the datasets will only ever cover the
 * files that have been uplaoded already at the point an id is to be resolved!
 * So try to structure your setup in a way that all the non-referencing data
 * is defined first with subsequent blocks of data that refernces only ids
 * that have been fully populated already. Note talso that you can include 
 * multiple {@link DatasetSetup dataset} sections for the same dataset to account
 * for complex referencing situations (but you potentially have to provide 
 * metadata for that dataset in a redundant form, depending on the files contained).
